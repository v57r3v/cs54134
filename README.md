Argument   Mapping for Scientific Articles
Introduction 
What are they?
Argument   maps are visual tools that allow us to see   the   steps   that   take   an   argument   from the   premises or evidence to the conclusions they support.
There are   many ways to create argument   maps and they   have   been   implemented   in many different ways for different   purposes.   Here we use them to   understand the structure of a scientific argument. Therefore,   in this document   I   use the term   “argument   map” to   mean “argument   map for empirical, scientific, or academic arguments”   . 
The following diagram shows the general structure of an argument   map   the way   we   use   them.

The   most   important aspect of the tree structure above is that   its   branches   end   in   “data”   and “evidence”   . This   is what differentiates a scientific (empirical)   argument   from   other types of arguments. A scientific argument relies on data   and   empirical   evidence   for   its validity.   Data   is the   ultimate arbiter. Sometimes we   rely on others who   have   provided   empirical evidence to support a claim.   In such   cases a   claim   is   supported   by   a “reference” to other scholars.   It   is important to remember that   a   scientific   argument   is   not valid just   because a scientist   has said so. 
What are they   useful for?
For our purposes, argument   maps   help us understand   the   reasoning   of   researchers   and   figure out areas where they   may be wrong.   By discovering error   in   other   researchers arguments, we   have a chance to create   new arguments that   lead to   new   conclusions and discoveries. This   process of detecting errors and improving   on   previous work   is   an   essential core of scientific   research and scientific   progress. Science   is a   collaborative and constructive endeavor, where   previous discoveries and arguments   build the   path for   future ones.   It   is   important to   make sure that we   build scientific   knowledge that   is true, accurate, and as error-free as possible. Argument   maps   can   help   us   achieve this   goal. 
Argument   mapping   is also extremely   helpful   in structuring our own thoughts and   making   our own arguments   more clear for other researchers.   If you are   interested   in writing a scholarly   piece, you can use an argument   map to   structure your thoughts   and   create   a   blueprint of what you   need to write. Then you can expand on that   map   to   create   the actual sections and subsections of your paper.   Finally you add   the   paragraphs   that create the smooth transitions from each claim to the   next, connecting   your   data/evidence to your main claim/conclusion. 
Why should   I   care?
Not every argument   made   by a scientist or researcher   is   equally   valid.   Some   arguments   are   more erroneous than others.   Errors can seep into   our   reasoning from   various sources.   It   might   be the way we collected our evidence.   It   might   be the way we defined      our theoretical concepts. Or it   might be that we   did   not   think   of   alternative   explanations.   Sometimes such errors are   harmless, and we or others can   catch   and   correct   them   if need   be.   However, sometimes such errors are extremely   harmful. An example   of a terribly   harmful case   is the   research that claimed a link   between   the   MMR vaccine   and   autism. The study was erroneous   in   many   many ways and   has caused damage   at   an extremely   large and   international scale.   If you would like to   know   more, this article provides a relatively good summary of its problems. You can   read the original report on all the errors in that study here. The   bottom   line   is that we   need to   make sure   we   have   a   way to spot errors   in our arguments and   reasoning   if we want to avoid   causing   harm   to         ourselves and others. 
Making sure we don’t   have errors   in our reasoning and   arguments   is   in   some   ways similar to housecleaning and maintenance. We need   to   know   the   structure   of the   house and what   needs   repair or cleaning. This   is what argument   maps can do for our arguments and thoughts.   But we should also   know that   it   is   impossible to   have everything   100% clean and   repaired all the time. Some things   are   more   important   to   be   clean and functioning than others.   It depends on   how they affect   us   and   what   our limitations are. So   it   is   important to do   our knowledge   maintenance   in   a way   that satisfies our goals.   Finally, similar to an unclean   house, the   cause   of   reasoning full   of errors   is often   laziness.   If we   put the time and care   into   how we think, we can   make   sure   that we   remove the   harmful errors and   make life easier for ourselves   and   others. 
Research on the   Role of Argument   Maps   in   Improving Analytical   Reasoning 
There   is growing   research showing argument   maps help the development   of analytical   and critical thinking.      Here   is a   recent study:
Cullen, Fan, van der Brugge  Elga (2018): Improving analytical reasoning and argument understanding: a quasi-experimental field study of argument visualization. npj Science of Learning. 3: 21. 
Elements of an Argument   Map 
What elements you use to construct your argument   map   depends   on the   type   of argument and what your goal   is for argument   mapping.   Here   I   present a list   of common   and useful elements   for mapping arguments   in   scientific   studies.
Data
Every scientific   paper has a way of presenting you with the   data   that   they   co代 写Argument Mapping for Scientific ArticlesProlog

Interpretation of   Data
The same graph or pattern of data   may   receive different   interpretations.   It   is   important   to   understand   how the authors of a   paper interpret their data and what   are   possible alternative   interpretations of what they found.   It   is common   in scientific studies to   miss   alternative   interpretations at this stage and reach conclusions   that   do   not   necessarily follow. 
(Supporting) Claims
Claims are   propositions that the authors are committed to,   so that   they   can   conclude   the   main   point or the   main claim. Claims can   provide support for   each   other   and   clarify the chain of reasoning   in an   argument.
Main   Claim
There   is often a   main claim or a few   main claims   in   a   scientific   paper.   The   main   claim   of a   paper is the conclusion or culmination of   its   arguments.   For   it to   be   valid,   all   the   prior   steps that   lead to   it   must   be valid. The   process of making a scientific   argument   is difficult   precisely   because   inferential errors can appear at any step that   leads   to   the main conclusion. An argument   map   helps   us understand the steps that   lead   to   a   main   conclusion and makes tracking the sources   of errors   easier. 
References
Sometimes authors do   not   provide data and evidence to support   a   particular   claim   but rather refer to other researchers who   have done so. We   can   include   the   references   in our argument   map underneath the claim that they   support.
Definitions
As we create argument   maps, we often   notice that whether an argument   is valid   or   not      crucially depends on precise definitions of some concepts   or theoretical   constructs.   We   can   include the definitions that the authors   provide,   perhaps as a footnote   to   our argument   map.
Assumptions
Sometimes we   notice that   the authors   have   implicit or explicit assumptions that are critical for the validity of the argument.   We can include these   assumptions   as well   and keep track of them.   If we   believe that these assumptions do   not   hold, then the argument   is   not going to   be valid and we   need to find a way to   address   the   issue   and   improve   the      argument.
Objections
Sometimes we can find   problems with the reasoning that the authors   provide. We   can   also add those   problems as “objections” to the argument   map so   that   we   remember where the errors were and where improvements   need to   happen.
A worked-out example 
Take a look at   the   following   scientific   article:
Suzuki, Wheatcroft,  Griesser (2016). Experimental evidence for compositional syntax in bird calls. Nature Communications 
The diagram   is a small argument   map   I   made for the scientific   paper above:
At the   lowest   level we   have the graphs (presentation of data) that the   paper   provides for   its arguments.   Higher up   I   have summarized   how the authors   interpreted the data   they         collected.   Higher up   I   have shown   how those   interpretations connect to two theoretical         constructs: “compositional”   interpretation and “sequential”   interpretation. The authors have argued for compositional calls   in   Parus   Minor by showing that:   1)   it   is compositional and 2)   it   is   not sequential.   Finally at the top of the   map we   have their   main claims: that compositionality   is   not unique   to   humans. 
At this   point, the argument   map   makes one   issue clear. The theoretical constructs “sequential” and “compositional”   interpretation are central to   the arguments   of the   paper.   Therefore, the   paper needs to   provide a clear definition of these   concepts.   I   have included the definition that the   paper implicitly alludes to   below.   I   have   also   included   an   objection to this definition   provided   by a linguist,   Mark   Liberman. 
● DEFINITION: combination of symbols   like A+B   can   be   interpreted
compositionally or sequentially.   In sequential   interpretation, every ordering of symbols   is   interpretable. This   is   not the case   in   rule-based   interpretation. Only   symbol combinations that   have corresponding rules are   interpretable.
○ OBJECTION:   Even   in sequential   interpretation, a sequence   might   not   be   interpretable due to   pragmatic   reasons. (Mark   Liberman,   language   log post http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=24561)Take a   look at the argument   map above again. What   types   of errors   can we   expect   at   each level of the argument?   How   important are they for the   purpose of the   argument?   How can we address these   errors?
Research   in the   News 
Take a   look at the following   news articles   reporting on the original   study   you just   read.
1. Syntax is not unique to humans! (phys.org) 
2. Japanese great tits use syntax to communicate – just like humans (IBT) 
3. Birds have syntax just like humans do 
4. Great Tits Use Linguistic Traits Including Phrases Thought To Be Unique To Humans 
5. Good Grammar Is a Matter of Life or Death for Japanese Tits 
Discuss   how accurately these   news articles   reflect the true content of the   research   article?
What are the consequences of representing scientific   research   inaccurately?
How can we   make sure we are   not contributing to the spread   of   misinformation?
